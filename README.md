# user-profile-Segmentation

🚀 Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end User Profile Segmentation pipeline using Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) principles. It classifies users into different segments based on behavior, demographics, or interaction data.

We use:

✅ FastAPI for serving the model as a REST API

🐳 Docker for containerization

📦 MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry

📡 DagsHub for data versioning, model tracking, and collaboration




✨ Clustering or Classification-based Segmentation

📦 MLflow integration for tracking metrics, parameters, models

🚀 FastAPI for scalable REST API

🐳 Docker for containerization

⛓️ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

🔁 DVC for dataset and model versioning (via DagsHub)

🎯 Configurable pipelines via YAML
